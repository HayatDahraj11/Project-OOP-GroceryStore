# Project-OOP-GroceryStore
An Object Oriented Approach To GroceryMarket Application (Terminal Based)

A simple Terminal Based  C++ Code For SuperMarket Grocery Shopping. Written Considering The Principles Of Object Oriented Design(OOD), Mainly polymorphism, encapsulation,inheritance. Also Contains Binary File Handling.  User Can Login, CreateAccount,  ShopGroceryItems, Pay. To Not Bore The User To Death, I Added Terminal Colours, These Change On Every Landing Page. 

Terminal Colors are added using Ansi Codes. These are wrapped in a string object.

This was a university project. First attempt at making a whole system.
